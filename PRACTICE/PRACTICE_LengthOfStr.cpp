    its a basic knowlage -  what happens inside a string
    whenever we declare a string a null character is assigned by the compiler during
    compilation to understand the end of an array. ' \0 ' is called null character or
    null terminator which holds the ascii value of 0 . 

    eg. it looks like this
    std::string arr[]={'f','a','r','d','i','n','\0'};

    so if we find the null character that means we hit the end of the array.

    return 0;
